# Smart City Traffic Management System

## Abstract
Efficient road traffic management is crucial for smart city operations. This project proposes a framework to estimate and convey vehicle counts in real time, enabling effective traffic congestion management. By utilizing image processing techniques, the system predicts vehicle numbers approaching a crowded junction and transmits this data to a central controlling station via the Internet of Things (IoT).

## Introduction
Real-time traffic density prediction has gained popularity over traditional CCTV-based systems. This section outlines the challenges faced in traffic flow analysis and introduces the novel blend of image processing techniques used for Traffic Density Analysis.

## Literature Review
This section provides an overview of AI-based methodologies, applications, challenges, and performance metrics related to traffic analysis. It covers techniques such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and discusses their applications in traffic analysis scenarios.

## Methodology
The system employs image processing to automatically count vehicles passing through a designated location. The process involves capturing real-time traffic footage, image processing for vehicle detection, and communicating the vehicle count to a central control system.
